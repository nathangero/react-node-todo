# React + Node/Express Todo 

## Description

This is a simple React todo app with a Node.js/Express.js server.

The functionality of this website is just simple CRUD actions, and will serve as a baseline for learning other frameworks and languages. For example, if I want to try and learn Go or Elixir, this is a simple start to what a server could do. The same goes for the frontend, where if I want to learn something like Angular, I have a starting point of what it should look and act like.

## Tech Stack

* React (from Vite)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
